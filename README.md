## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This project documents a comprehensive exploration into keylogger technology, encompassing initial simulation and analysis, the development of custom tools for offensive and defensive security learning, and future plans for enhancement and deployment.

---

## Initial Keylogger Simulation <a name="initial-keylogger-simulation"></a>

The project commenced with a hands-on simulation of a keylogger attack using an existing Python-based tool (`python-keylogger`). This crucial first step provided practical insights into how keyloggers operate, including their logging mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities. The analysis of the simulated keylogger's behavior informed the subsequent development of the custom tools.

## StrokeCap v2.0 <a name="strokecap-v20"></a>

A custom Python-based keylogger engineered to capture keystrokes and log them in JSON format, including timestamps, special key descriptions, and platform detection. It also includes basic parsing to display captured keystrokes after logging.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing StrokeCap.py
cd ZeroStroke/
# Run the keylogger
python3 StrokeCap.py
Press ESC in the terminal where StrokeCap is running to stop the logging. Captured keystrokes will be saved in a file named stroke_cap_log.txt in the same directory, and a basic parsed output will be displayed in the terminal.

Zero Stroke
A basic Python-based countermeasure tool designed to detect potential keylogging activity by analyzing file systems and running processes for indicators associated with keyloggers, including StrokeCap. It provides alerts via console output and structured JSON logging to a file named zero_stroke_alerts.log.

Usage:

Bash

# Navigate to the directory containing ZeroStroke.py
cd ZeroStroke/
# Run the countermeasure tool
python3 ZeroStroke.py
Zero Stroke will scan for suspicious activity and output alerts to the console. Details of the alerts will also be logged in JSON format to zero_stroke_alerts.log in the same directory.
