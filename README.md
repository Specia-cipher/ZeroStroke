üõ°Ô∏è Zero Stroke - Keylogger Analysis & Countermeasure

A hands-on project focused on understanding keylogger operation through practical simulation with an existing tool and the development of a custom basic keylogger, followed by building a countermeasure solution. This lab will explore the mechanics of keyloggers and aim to create a tool to detect and potentially mitigate their activity.

üî• Key Features (Planned)

* **Hands-on Experience with Python Keylogger:** Successfully simulated and analyzed a keylogger attack using an existing Python-based tool to gain practical understanding of its operation.
* Custom Basic Keylogger Development: Building a fundamental keylogger from scratch in the lab to gain in-depth understanding of core functionalities.
* "Zero stroke" Countermeasure: Development of a tool to identify and respond to keylogging attempts, informed by both simulated attacks and the development process of a keylogger.
* Modular Design: The project will be structured in a modular way to allow for the addition of various detection and response techniques.
* Cross-Platform Exploration: Initial development and testing on a Linux environment (Backbox VM) followed by adaptation for Android (Termux/UserLAnd).

üöÄ Quick Start (Initial Thoughts)

1.  Set up an isolated testing environment (Backbox VM).
2.  Simulated a keylogger attack using an existing Python-based tool to analyze its behavior.
3.  Begin the development of a custom basic keylogger to understand its core mechanics.
4.  Develop the "Zero stroke" countermeasure based on the insights gained.

üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap

**Phase 1: Keylogger Attack Simulation & Insight Gathering (Computer)**
* **Goal:** To gain real, actionable insight into keylogger operation through direct simulation using an existing tool (`python-keylogger`).
* **Tasks:** Set up an Isolated Testing Environment, Install and Run a Test Keylogger, Simulate User Activity, Analyze Keylogger Logs.

**Phase 1b: Custom Basic Keylogger Development (Computer/Phone)**
* **Goal:** To develop a fundamental keylogger to understand its core functionalities and implementation details.
* **Tasks:** Research basic keylogging techniques, implement a simple keylogger in Python, test its basic functionality.

**Phase 2: Developing the "Zero stroke" Countermeasure (Computer/Phone)**
* **Goal:** To build the core functionality of your anti-keylogger based on the insights gained from both the existing keylogger simulation and the development of your own keylogger.
* **Tasks:** Identify Key Indicators, Develop Detection Logic, Implement Initial Response Mechanisms.

**Phase 3: Porting and Adapting to Phone Environment (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To transfer the foundational "Zero stroke" code to your mobile environment for further development and testing.
* **Tasks:** Push Code to Repository, Clone to Phone, Adapt for Android Compatibility.

**Phase 4: Enhancing "Zero stroke" and Testing (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To improve the detection and response capabilities of "Zero stroke" and test its effectiveness within the mobile environment.
* **Tasks:** Implement Advanced Detection, Develop Stronger Countermeasures, Simulated Testing.

**Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To thoroughly document your "Zero stroke" project.
* **Tasks:** Write Comprehensive README, Code Review and Comments, Final Commit and Push.

**Tools (Anticipated)**

* Virtualization Software (VirtualBox, VMware)
* Backbox Linux VM
* Existing Python-based Keylogger (`python-keylogger`)
* Python Programming Language
* System Monitoring Libraries (e.g., `psutil`)
* Development Environment (VS Code, Sublime Text)
* Git
* Termux or Kali via UserLAnd (on Android)
* Text Editor (on phone)
