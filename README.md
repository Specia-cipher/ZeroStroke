üõ°Ô∏è Zero Stroke - Keylogger Analysis & Countermeasure

A hands-on project focused on understanding keylogger operation through practical simulation and developing a countermeasure solution. This lab will explore how keyloggers function and aim to build a tool to detect and potentially mitigate their activity.

üî• Key Features (Planned)

* **Keylogger Simulation:** In-depth analysis of real keylogger behavior in a controlled environment.
* **"Zero stroke" Countermeasure:** Development of a tool to identify and respond to keylogging attempts.
* **Modular Design:** The project will be structured in a modular way to allow for the addition of various detection and response techniques.
* **Cross-Platform Exploration:** Initial development on a Linux environment followed by adaptation for Android (Termux/UserLAnd).

üöÄ Quick Start (Initial Thoughts)

1.  Set up an isolated testing environment (Backbox VM recommended).
2.  Install a test keylogger (for educational purposes and within ethical boundaries).
3.  Analyze the keylogger's behavior and logs.
4.  Begin developing the "Zero stroke" countermeasure.

üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap

**Phase 1: Keylogger Attack Simulation & Insight Gathering (Computer)**
* **Goal:** To gain real, actionable insight into keylogger operation on your system through direct simulation.
* **Tasks:** Set up an Isolated Testing Environment, Install a Test Keylogger, Simulate User Activity, Analyze Keylogger Logs.

**Phase 2: Developing the "Zero stroke" Countermeasure (Computer)**
* **Goal:** To build the core functionality of your anti-keylogger based on the insights gained from the simulation.
* **Tasks:** Identify Key Indicators, Develop Detection Logic, Implement Initial Response Mechanisms.

**Phase 3: Porting and Adapting to Phone Environment (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To transfer the foundational "Zero stroke" code to your mobile environment for further development and testing.
* **Tasks:** Push Code to Repository, Clone to Phone, Adapt for Android Compatibility.

**Phase 4: Enhancing "Zero stroke" and Simulated Testing (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To improve the detection and response capabilities of "Zero stroke" and test its effectiveness within the mobile environment.
* **Tasks:** Implement Advanced Detection, Develop Stronger Countermeasures, Simulated Testing.

**Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To thoroughly document your "Zero stroke" project.
* **Tasks:** Write Comprehensive README, Code Review and Comments, Final Commit and Push.

**Tools (Anticipated)**

* Virtualization Software (VirtualBox, VMware)
* Backbox Linux VM
* Ethical Keylogger for Testing (or Python for a basic one)
* Python Programming Language
* System Monitoring Libraries (e.g., `psutil`)
* Development Environment (VS Code, Sublime Text)
* Git
* Termux or Kali via UserLAnd (on Android)
* Text Editor (on phone)
