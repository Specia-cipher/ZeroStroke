## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This project started with a hands-on simulation of a keylogger using an existing tool to understand its behavior. Following this initial insight, a custom keylogger named StrokeCap v2.0 was successfully developed using Python. The next phase of this project involves building a countermeasure tool named "Zero stroke" to detect and mitigate keylogging activities. StrokeCap v2.0 features comprehensive keystroke logging in JSON format, along with basic parsing to display captured keystrokes.

## üî• Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

* **Hands-on Keylogger Simulation:** Conducted a practical simulation using an external Python keylogger to gain a foundational understanding of keylogging techniques.
* **Custom Keylogger Development (StrokeCap v2.0):** Engineered a Python-based keylogger (StrokeCap v2.0) with advanced features:
    * Keystroke logging in JSON format.
    * Inclusion of timestamps for every key event.
    * Detailed logging of special keys (e.g., `[SHIFT]`, `[ENTER]`).
    * Detection and logging of the operating system platform.
    * Clear indication of "PRESS" and "RELEASE" events.
    * Basic JSON parsing functionality to display the captured keystrokes after logging.
* **JSON Logging:** Utilizes a structured JSON format for log entries, facilitating easy data parsing and potential future analysis.
* **Basic JSON Parsing:** Implements a basic parsing mechanism to read the `stroke_cap_log.txt` file and display the captured keystrokes in a readable format after logging stops.
* **Next Plan:** To develop "Zero stroke," a countermeasure tool designed to detect and neutralize keylogging attempts.
* Modular Design: The project is designed with a modular approach to enable the integration of diverse detection and response strategies.
* Cross-Platform Exploration: Primarily developed and tested on a Linux environment (Backbox VM), with consideration for future adaptation to Android (Termux/UserLAnd).

## üöÄ Quick Start <a name="quick-start"></a>

1.  Gained initial experience by simulating a keylogger attack using an existing tool.
2.  Successfully developed StrokeCap v2.0, a custom keylogger with JSON logging and basic parsing capabilities.
3.  The subsequent step is to commence the development of "Zero stroke," the keylogger countermeasure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap <a name="roadmap"></a>

**Phase 1: Keylogger Simulation & Insight Gathering (Computer)**
* **Goal:** To acquire practical knowledge of keylogger behavior through direct simulation.
* **Tasks:** Utilize an external keylogger to simulate and analyze keystroke capture.

**Phase 2: Custom Keylogger Engineering (StrokeCap v2.0) (Computer/Phone)**
* **Goal:** To build a feature-rich keylogger for in-depth understanding of its mechanisms.
* **Tasks:** Develop StrokeCap v1.0 (printing to console), v1.1 (saving to file), and v2.0 (comprehensive JSON logging and basic parsing).

**Phase 3: Countermeasure Development ("Zero stroke") (Computer/Phone)**
* **Goal:** To engineer a tool capable of detecting and responding to keylogging activities.
* **Tasks:** Research detection techniques, design the architecture of "Zero stroke," implement detection and response functionalities.

**Phase 4: Porting and Cross-Platform Adaptation (Phone)**
* **Goal:** To adapt and test "Zero stroke" on mobile environments.
* **Tasks:** Port the codebase to Android (Termux/UserLAnd), optimize for mobile, conduct thorough testing.

**Phase 5: Enhancement and Refinement (Phone/Computer)**
* **Goal:** To improve the effectiveness and robustness of "Zero stroke."
* **Tasks:** Implement advanced detection methods, enhance response capabilities, conduct extensive testing and debugging.

**Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization (Phone/Computer)**
* **Goal:** To complete comprehensive documentation for the entire project.
* **Tasks:** Write detailed README, provide code comments, finalize project documentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To run the StrokeCap v2.0 keylogger, navigate to the directory where you have saved the `StrokeCap.py` file in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
python3 StrokeCap.py
The script will start logging keystrokes in JSON format to a file named stroke_cap_log.txt in the same directory. After you press the ESC key to stop the logging, the script will then attempt to parse the log file and display the captured keystrokes in the terminal.
